          Built in the 5th century AD, Sigiriya served as both a palace and fortress for King Kasyapa (477-495 AD). The site was 
          chosen for its strategic value, rising 200 meters above the surrounding plain. The name "Sigiriya" derives from the 
          Sinhalese word for lion, referencing the enormous lion gateway that once guarded the entrance to the palace on the 
          summit.
